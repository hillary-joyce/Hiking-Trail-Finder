This hiking trail finder is a fast and easy way to find hiking trails.

GW Coding Bootcamp, January 2018

The idea for this project came from me and my co-developers love for the outdoors. It was winter in Washington DC, and we couldn't wait to get back out on the trail. By uisng the Hiking Trail Data API, we were able to collect what we felt was the most important information for users trying to determine which trail to visit, without causing information overload.
